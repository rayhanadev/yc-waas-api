# YC Work at a Startup API

YC's [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com) doesn't have a great API to query data. I didn't feel like making a scraper, so I reverse-engineered the site instead!

I wrote a blog post detailing the process in more detail [here](https://www.rayhanadev.com/blog/2025-06-08-reverse-engineering-yc/). Give it a read! :)
